### Changes added in TinkerOS 5.06.2:
- Improved documentation, now global variable symbols, ASM symbols, and defined constants are now links. Also fixed documentation containing symbols which are the same color as the background for examples see <a href="https://templeos.holyc.xyz/Wb/Kernel/KMisc.html#l179">here</a> vs <a href="https://tinkeros.github.io/WbGit/Kernel/KMisc.html#l191">here</a>.
- Fixed more broken documentation links.
- Fixed Adam AutoComplete warnings on bootup.
- Clean up more $ characters from compiler exceptions in raw mode.
- Improved Seth Graphics Helper compatibility with older versions of QEMU (curse you Ubuntu for never updating QEMU, note that OSTestSuite/some of Terry's examples will still fail on some old versions of QEMU as they do in regular TempleOS)
- Fixed screen cache not being flushed after palette change.
- Disabled debug COM1 output so it can be used for other purposes
- Moved serial port code to Adam
- Fixed Aunt Nellie in OT1975

### Semi-complete list of changes between Terry's last TempleOS release and TinkerOS 5.06:
- Documentation similar to templeos.holyc.xyz, but functions are linkable and content which normally can only be accessed within TempleOS is now available on the web (see <a href="https://tinkeros.github.io/WbGit/Doc/HelpIndex.html#l93">here.</a>)
- VBE2 video mode support, provides 2x 4:3 (640x480 or 800x600) and 2x wide screen resolutions (<a href="https://youtu.be/E8UvMijEiUA">640x340</a> or 1280x512).  This can be configured using the auto installer or when building/configuring the kernel.
- Modified installer to make it easy to install with different resolutions and easy to optionally copy additional software to your installation.
- SSE support is enabled on the CPU (for now only used by some 3rd party apps)
- If you have more than 1 core a second core is used to help render providing a faster system (since normally everything by default happens on core 1).  This is particularly useful when running it on slow Intel Atom chips or under QEMU on other architectures.
- Added AfterEgypt and Chess so you don't have to dig into the supplemental discs to run them.
- Fixed Chess and Titanium (now called SpyHunt and changed a bit).
- Added an old school Oregon Trail text adventure.
- Minor improvements to Kernel to cause it to use less calls to MAlloc.
- Slipstreamed additional software in Extras folder so you can just use MountFile to mount extra discs and don't have to deal with changing virtual cd drives.
- You can dynamically change the frame rate SetFPS(60);
- Some people are annoyed by blinking and scrolling, functions ToggleBlink and ToggleScroll exist.
- You may access the up/down state of multiple keys without message parsing, see new <a href="https://tinkeros.github.io/WbGit/Demo/KeyState.html">KeyState Demo</a>
- When on the command line if you mis-type a command followed by a ; and hit enter, you may be able to re-paste your last command if it is still scrolling as text in the top of the window by using the F8 key.
- BMP file support has been restored.
- Raw mode text is also dumped out COM1 which helps when debugging the kernel without a display.
- Compiler now has an option to not warn about unused externs.
- When on the command line a Cd is frequently followed with a Dir so Cdd was born to do both.
- Modified Find to have optional parameter max_cnt which will limit number of results returned (otherwise for some patterns it can find so much it crashes the entire OS).
- Modified Profiler to output the function with the largest CPU percentage at the bottom of the output.
- Improvements to TaskRep output and FindTaskByTitle helps locate tasks by name.
- Mouse no longer dumps random characters into the debugger.
- Some exceptions have been tweaked so parts of the exceptions which previously were covered are now able to be seen.
- Pruned and refactored Adam so some things can be disabled in <a href="https://tinkeros.github.io/WbGit/MakeHome.html">MakeHome.HC</a> to improve performance on low power machines.
- Moved some of Adam to the Kernel so many useful file operations are avaiable before Adam is loaded.
- Removed Task Memory address from top bar to make room for more CPUs to be able to be displayed.
- Fixed Dir missing default arguments (which prevents default usage when KernelC.HH not in scope).
- Fixed IsDir hang if called with a path to an unmounted drive.
- MountIDEAuto now has ability to mount only ATAPI drives via optional parameter.
